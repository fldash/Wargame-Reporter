Wargame-Reporter
================
Wargame: Red Dragon launcher application which reports player information to a server as well as end game results (only winner / loser).  It only requires a single player in the match to be running the Reporter for results to be reported.  

No Wargame: Red Dragon information is modified by this program.  This includes files on disk, memory, or packets sent and received.


This is still in alpha.  I'm not an experienced C# coder, I'm a DBA, but decided to try to implement something which could give players a ranking in Red Dragon since ranked games are seldomly played.
